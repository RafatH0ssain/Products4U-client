            On This Route the user will show all the recommendations made by him from the recommendation collection in a table format. With some details ( it's up to you ). 

User canâ€™t modify his recommendation.  He can only delete recommendations.  So create a button for deleting his recommendation.  Hitting the delete button will delete the recommendation with confirmation.  

After successful  deletion decreases the recommendation count of the query.
